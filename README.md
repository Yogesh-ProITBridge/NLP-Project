CV Classifier Project :

I've collected a few resumes of various designations and converted the pdfs to dox. Save it as a CSV file. Then, choose a few classification models to develop models from and compare their accuracy.

Steps I followed:
- DE, DS, JD, MDE - These file names include original CV files downloaded from Google.
- Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Java Developer, Mechanical Design Engineer - These file names contain cv files that have been converted from pdf to docx.
- The resume classifier Python program will demonstrate how to alter the pdf to docx conversion and extract the text from the doxc file and save it as a csv file.
- The classification models Python file will show you what models I use for model development.
 
I'm sharing the accuracy of the models, I built : Accuracy.docx file

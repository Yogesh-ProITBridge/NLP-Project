I often work on various, independent projects which requires me to be able to quickly learn new technologies and apply them to real world problems. In current my role I develop, maintain and improve streaming data pipelines for End-To-End IoT solutions, and further analyse the outputs to get an insight into the data collected. Furthermore, I usually participate in various ad-hoc side projects where data science and ML skills are essential to tackle the problems in hand.\\n\\nTomi Illes\\n\\n\\nData Scientist\\n\\nportfolio: tomilles.com\\n\\nlinkedin.com/in/tomilles\\n\\ntomilles97@gmail.com\\n\\nTechnikal skills\\n\\n\\u2022Data Science: \\nPython, Pandas, NumPy, SQL, regex, Matlab, R, ETL, IoT, EDA, Seaborn, Matplotlib, web scraping, Selenium\\n\\n\\t\\u2022Big Data: \\n\\tDatabricks, PySpark, DWH\\n\\nEXPERIENCE\\n\\nIoT Data Engineer\\n\\nIFUA Horv\\u00e1th, December 2021 \\u2014 present\\n\\n\\t\\u2022 Plan, create, manage and maintain end-to-end IoT data pipelines in Azure\\u2028\\nusing IoT Hub, Azure Data Explorer, DataLakes, Logic Apps, Synapse\\n\\n\\u2022 Analyse historical data from IoT devices to identify outliers, correlations and energy saving opportunities for clients in Databricks using Python and PySpark\\n\\n\\u2022 Develop ETL processes (SSIS, SSMS, SQL) and backend data models in PBI\\n\\u2022 Developed analytical tools in Python for domain experts\\n\\n\\u2022 Regularly research novel IoT techniques and advances\\n\\nData Engineer\\n\\nNeuron Solutions, 2022, 6 months freelancing\\n\\n\\t\\u2022 Carried out image based fault detection model inferences, EDA, and performance analysis and evaluation to improve the ML model\\n\\n\\u2022 Using Pandas, SpaCy, NER and regex extracted information from medical text data to prepare it for ML training purposes to predict lung tumor stages\\n\\nData Science Intern\\n\\n\\nIFUA Horv\\u00e1th, 2017, 2 months\\n\\n\\u2022ML: \\nSKlearn, PyTorch, spaCy, SciPy, Tensorflow, Keras, CNN, NLP\\n\\n\\u2022Cloud -

I have been programming since the age of 11, and researching since 19. I have applied my skills to fields including cybersecurity, computer vision, AI ethics, biometrics, circuit design, cognitive psychology, social networks, and marketing. I received my doctorate in 2014 for work in biologically-inspired AI. For the last five years I worked as a Data Scientist and Machine Learning researcher at Booz Allen Hamilton, mostly doing research in Deep Learning with application to cybersecurity. More recently I have moved to Amazon to help them establish a Data Science team to support AWS Security.\\u2019 This is a moving target, and Donald Knuth defined science as \\u2018everything you can explain to a computer.\\n\\nI am interested in the application of algorithmic techniques to those fields where we can\\u2019t (yet) explain things fully to a computer.\\n\\nEducation\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u25e6University of Maryland \\n\\tPh.D. in Computer Science \\tSeptember 2014 \\t\\tDissertation: \\u201cNeurocomputational Methods for Autonomous Cognitive Control\\u201d\\n\\t\\tCommittee chair: James Reggia \\n\\tM.S. in Computer Science \\t\\tMay 2010\\n\\n\\t\\t\\u25e6University of Notre Dame \\n\\tB.S. in Computer Science, Magna cum Laude \\tMay 2006\\n\\nExperience\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\u25e6Amazon Web Services \\n\\tData Scientist, AWS Security\\n\\n\\n\\nAugust 2019 \\u2013 Present\\n\\n\\n\\nI build very large scale data analytic tools to enhance the security of AWS and its customers.

My work focused on Machine Learning research, especially in the domain of computer security. I developed software for feature extraction in cluster environments, and lead a project to evaluate deep learning techniques for our client. I focused on deep neural architectures for application to non-natural languages and cyberdefense, as well as research in neuromorphic computing. I also worked on internal investment projects developing machine learning techniques to mitigate algorithmic bias. Additionally, I assisted my team administratively by acting as our liaison for recruiting.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\u25e6UMD Smith School of Business, Center for Complexity in Business \\n\\t\\tDoctoral Research Assistant \\t\\tAugust 2012 \\u2013 September 2014 \\t\\tStudied the role of social networks on conversions to paid memberships in a freemium MMO game en-\\tvironment using large, dynamic, real-world network datasets.

Now I can confidently say that backend development is a profession which I can dedicate my entire life to.  For the last half a year I have been improving my skills in Java, Hibernate and Spring MVC. Implemented couple of projects using Web servers (Tomcat) and MySQL DBMS. Familiar with SOLID, KISS and YAGNI principles. Highly motivated to find a friendly team in which I can receive new challenges and grow as a developer. \\n\\nSKILLS\\n\\nTechnologies/Frameworks:\\u200b Java 8 (Collections API, Stream API, etc.), Web, Servlets, JSP, JDBC, Hibernate, JUnit5, Tomcat, Spring Web MVC, Spring Security, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, The Holy Trinity of front-end basics (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). \\n\\nRDBMS\\u200b: MySQL, Oracle DB. \\n\\nVersion Control Tools:\\u200b Git. \\n\\nPROJECTS \\nPhilharmonic app \\nLink: \\u200bhttps://github.com/less08/filarmonic-project \\nTechnologies used: Hibernate, Spring Web MVC, Spring Security. \\n\\nTaxi project \\nLink: \\u200bhttps://github.com/less08/taxi \\nFunctional description: simple application with basic operation.
